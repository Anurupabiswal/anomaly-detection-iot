# Anomaly Detection in IoT Sensor Data

## Overview
This project detects anomalies in IoT sensor data using Python and machine learning techniques.
It helps identify abnormal behavior for early fault detection and improved system reliability.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Anomaly detection using ML models
- Model evaluation

## Dataset
Occupancy Detection Dataset
